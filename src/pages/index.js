          I am a software engineer from Kansas City, MO. I have full-stack
          experience with Java, Angular, C#, and React. I specialize in
          front-end development, making clean and performant user interfaces
          that just work. If I'm not at my computer, I'm probably out running or
          playing Ultimate Frisbee.
